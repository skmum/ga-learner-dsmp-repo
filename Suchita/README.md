### Project Overview

 Spy Games! Who does not like playing spy games?

The project interested me from the word go. I was eager to get cracking. The project was going to test application of my newly learnt basic python coding skills.  The project brief given was very exciting! 
It said : "Hello lieutenant! It's with an emergency that our agency wishes to use the skills that you learned in 'python intermediate' module. Your mission if you choose to accept it, would be to help us decipher a message that we received from our intel. We have multiple text files that need to be read and have certain operations performed to get our final message. Good luck. The fate of humanity lies in your hands."

 I  was the lieutenant all set to decode the message with my newly learnt python skills. The task was to read the message received in a file, in fact extract a series of messages as it turned out susequently,  fuse them, substitute with a secret message, compare messages and filter messages to extract the desired message and finally, combine the bits of messages extracted to get the FINAL MESSAGE!! 

WHOA! Extracting the final message was so gratifying!! It indeed felt like being a diligent and dutiful spy ever willing to serve the nation and humanity!



### Learnings from the project

 The first and foremost thing I learnt was donning a spy's hat and to be vigilant and alert while decoding the messages and instructions given and then coding them to get the desired output. The complexity of tasks increased with each task and a lot of patience was required to get the code right particumarly the syntax, to pay attention to comas, underscores, colons, the parentheses, identation as well as the variables used, types of variables and string operations, key-words and construct of the code. I can summary my learning as :
1. How to open a file, the importance of entering the right file path while opening the file and how to read a line and that every file must be closed.
2. How to write functions. The python functions I wrote in this projects were - 
    a) to read a file, different modes in which a file can be opened - r, w, r+, w+, a, a+, how to read first line, more lines i.e. difference between readline() and     readlines(), how to store a file_path in a variable.
    b) to fuse two messages involving string operations. 
   c) to substitute a message if the given condition was met using conditional statements such as if-elif-else.
   d) to compare messages from different files, apply filter for the given condition, break the messages and join the remaining words to get the desired message
   e) to extract a message by breaking down messages, applying a function to extract the required words and them applying a filter to form the required message   from filtered words or strings.
   f) to write a file - open a file in append a+ mode, write a message and close file.
3.  Importance of 'return' statements and how I struggled to get the final message in the absence of a return statement.
4. How to call the user-defined functions and use them.
5. How to write conditional statements e.g.  if-elif-elif were used to read messages and substitue the message based on if the given condition was met
6. How to break a sentence (string of strings using split method and separator, also how to join strings to form a sentence or a string of strings.
7. How to use a lambda function for string operations to get length of strings.
8. How to use 'filter' for string operations
9. Paying minute attention to get the syntax of the code right as mentioned above.
10. How to write on a file and print the message i.e. the appended line in the file.
Overall, a very fruitful project!


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 The approach I took for solving this project was :
1. Reading the project brief and instructions carefully.
2. Learnig and practising the concepts covered hands-on as mentioned in the paragraph above.
3. Writing a code and trying it on, reading the errors and exception messages and debugging the code
4. Being more mindful of the typing errors and common syntax errors.
5. Submitting the code only after being certain about the accuracy of the code.


### Challenges faced

 Since I am still learning python and being new to programming, writing a code itself was a big challenge. So like a typical beginner, I had a tough time remembering the different concepts learnt, the correct syntax, getting the commas, colons, brackets, underscores and other signs right. I also struggled with defining functions, applying lambda function and filter, calling functions even with opening a file,  getting the path right, reading the first line and writing the file.

But as they say,  struggles and challenges are part of learning and growth so I enjoyed handling these challenges as they were part of the game.


### Additional pointers

 I loved the complexity of the project and how it increased from task to task. It was a project focused on string operations, functions - creating user defined functions as well as using lambda and filter functions from string operations, and file operations. It was a well-structured project and it did make feel like a spy all out on a mission to get the secret message to serve the humanity!

Thank you Grey Atom for making learning and doing projects so much fun! We look forward to more such interesting projects.
